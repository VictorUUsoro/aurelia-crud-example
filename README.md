# aurelia-crud-example
Simple CRUD application with aurelia tutorial.
This application uses **deployd**(https://github.com/deployd/deployd), so in orden to use it you should create a 
deployd app and create a table named contacts with 4 attributes: firstName, lastName, email and phoneNumber. This is a very simple
app, but it helps to ilustrate some Aurelia concepts.
